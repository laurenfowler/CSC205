The Personnel project is supposed to store a database of employee data, both salaried and hourly employees
The Employee class is an abstract class that both SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee extend
and its methods include: getName(), getWage(), setRaise(), and an abstract method called computePay()

HourlyEmployee extends Employee and the object stores infomation about an employee paid by the hour. 
It will compute overtime pay for employees that have worked over 40 hours. 

SalariedEmployee extends Employee and the object stores information about an employee paid on a yearly salary
The salary returned is based on the employee working 40 hours a week, for 52 weeks. 

The Personnel class runs the program. 
The switch statement takes in a char parameter which was inputted in the display menu method. 

displayMenu() prints out all the menu options and reads in a String but returns a char at position 0

When 'n' is selected, the switch statement calls getInfo() which takes infomation from the user about 
the name, type, and salary of the employee, and uses that infomration to call newEmployee() to create an
employee object. The employee object is then returned to the switch statement and added to the employee
array list. 

when 'c' is selected, the switch statement calls calculatePay() which takes input about the number of hours
an employee worked from a user and then returns the weekly salary of each employee

when 'r' is selcted, the switch statement calls raiseWages() which promts the user to input the percent increase
of salary for all employees, and the new wages are then returned 

when 'p' is selcted, the switch statement calls printRecords() which uses a for loop to print out the toString of each
employee object in the database array list

when 'd' is selected, the switch statement calls downData() which imports every object in the external file called
employees.dat

when 'p' is selected, the switch statment calls uploadData() which writes out every object in the database to an external file
employees.dat

when 'q' is selcted, the while loop breaks and the program is terminated.
