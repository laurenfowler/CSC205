algorithm: 

	--file is read in from the command line in the fileReader(String [] args) 
	  that takes in the .dat file as a parameter

	--the arrival queue in filled and an ouput queue is instantiated
	
	--an array is instaniated to hold usageTime and idleTime

	--processJobs() is called that takes paramters of an arrival and ouput queue, along with an array.
	  Instance variables clockTime, idleTime, and usageTime are created. A new queue called jobQueue is also created. 
		--there are several if statements inside the method. 
			-- the first if statement calls checkRecord(), a method that checks
		  	   to see if a job has arrived, and if it has it puts it in a jobQueue.
			-- the second if statement calls checkJobRecord() which does two things. The first thing job 
			   record does is check to see if a job needs to be removed from the jobQueue and inserted
			   into the output queue. The second thing job record does is check to see if a job needs to
			    be started, and also sets the wait time by subtracting the arrival time by the clockTime
			-- the third if statement also calls checkJobRecord() to see if another jobs needs to be started
			   in the same clock increment as a job is removed
			-- the fourth if statement increments idle time if the jobQueue is empty but the arrival queue is not
			-- the fifth if statement updates usage time if the jobQueue is not empty
		--once the algorithm has been gone through, the clockTime increments by one and the method loops while either
		  the job queue or arrival queue are not empty

	--the printReport() method is called to print out the CPU usage. It takes a paramter of an ouput Queue and an array 
	  with the idle time and usage time
		--Wait time is calucated by dividing the total wait time of each job by the total number or jobs
		--CPU usage time is calculated by dividing the usage time by the usage time plus the idle time
