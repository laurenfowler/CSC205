This program is supposed to simulate playing a game of Bingo by drawing random numbers and marking the card appropriatly

Sample input file: 
12 28 31 49 66
3 26 45 53 75
10 17 33 59 67
7 19 42 55 74 
2 23 37 46 70

Sample output: 
 print out all picked number and Horizontal Win after X picks!
 X X X X X
 3 26 X 53 75
 X X X 59 67
 X 19 42 55 X
 2 X 37 46 X
 
 My Algorithm: 
 
 I wrote a method to fill up the card from an input file
 
 I wrote a method to print out the card using nested for loops 
 and if it sees a 0, to print out an X instead
 
 My play game method takes a bitset, the card, and an array list as parameters
 It calls the pullNum method to recieve a random number and then checks to see if it is false
 if the number is false it pulls another number until one returns true and then uses that number
 to play the game and then set it to false so it is not used again 
 
 in my main method, it checks to see if my card is a win
 if the card is not a win it calls the playGame method and 
 checks for a win again
 Once there is a win it goes to the printWin method that prints out 
 the line of code that relates to the particular type of win 
 
 to check for a win, the checkWin method sums up all the horizontal, 
 vertical, and diagonal sums and sends back a certian number depending 
 on the type of win. If there is no win it returns a zero
